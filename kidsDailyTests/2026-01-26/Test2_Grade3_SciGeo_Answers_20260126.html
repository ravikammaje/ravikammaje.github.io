                <p class="working"><strong>The Water Cycle:</strong></p>
                <p class="working">1. <strong>Evaporation:</strong> The Sun heats water in oceans, rivers, lakes, and ponds. The water turns into water vapor (gas) and rises up into the air.</p>
                <p class="working">2. <strong>Condensation:</strong> When water vapor rises high in the sky, it becomes cool. The cool water vapor changes back into tiny water droplets. These droplets come together to form clouds.</p>
                <p class="working">3. <strong>Precipitation:</strong> When the clouds become heavy with water droplets, water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail. This is called precipitation.</p>
                <p class="working">4. The water collects in rivers, lakes, and oceans, and the cycle starts again.</p>
