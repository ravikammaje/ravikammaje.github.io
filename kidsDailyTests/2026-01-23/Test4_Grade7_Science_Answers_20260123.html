    <h2>Section C: Long Answer Questions (20 Marks)</h2>
    
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>11.</strong> <strong>Process of Digestion in Humans:</strong><br>
        Digestion is the process of breaking down complex food into simpler, soluble forms that can be absorbed by the body.<br>
        <br><strong>Organs involved:</strong> Mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine<br>
        <br><strong>In the Stomach:</strong><br>
        • Food enters the stomach from the esophagus<br>
        • Gastric glands in stomach wall secrete gastric juice containing hydrochloric acid and enzyme pepsin<br>
        • The acid kills bacteria and creates acidic environment for pepsin to work<br>
        • Pepsin breaks down proteins into simpler forms<br>
        • Stomach muscles churn food and mix it with gastric juice, forming a semi-liquid paste<br>
        <br><strong>In the Small Intestine:</strong><br>
        • Food enters from stomach in small amounts<br>
        • Receives bile (from liver) and pancreatic juice (from pancreas)<br>
        • Intestinal juice is also secreted<br>
        • Complete digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats occurs here<br>
        • Digested food is absorbed through villi (finger-like projections) into blood<br>
        • Absorbed nutrients are transported to all body cells<br>
        <em>Award marks for: mentioning organs (1), stomach functions (1.5), small intestine functions (1.5).</em>

        1. <strong>Cell Wall:</strong> Provides shape, support, and protection to the plant cell<br>
        2. <strong>Cell Membrane:</strong> Controls movement of substances in and out of the cell<br>
        3. <strong>Cytoplasm:</strong> Jelly-like substance where cellular activities occur<br>
        4. <strong>Nucleus:</strong> Controls all cell activities and contains genetic material (DNA)<br>
        5. <strong>Chloroplast:</strong> Contains chlorophyll and is the site of photosynthesis<br>
        6. <strong>Vacuole:</strong> Large sac filled with cell sap; stores water, minerals, and waste<br>
        <br><em>Award marks as follows:</em><br>
        • Proper cell outline/shape (0.5 marks)<br>
        • Five correctly labeled parts (1.5 marks)<br>
        • Five correct functions (2 marks)<br>
        <em>Note: Student should draw a diagram. Accept reasonable drawings with proper labels.</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>13.</strong> <strong>Conductors vs Insulators of Heat:</strong><br>
        <strong>Conductors:</strong> Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily.<br>
        Examples: Metals like iron, copper, aluminum, silver<br>
        <strong>Insulators:</strong> Materials that do not allow heat to pass through them easily.<br>
        Examples: Wood, plastic, rubber, air, wool<br>
        <br><strong>Experiment to show metals are good conductors:</strong><br>
        1. Take a metal rod (like iron or copper) and a wooden rod of same size<br>
        2. Fix small wax pieces at equal distances on both rods using melted wax<br>
        3. Heat one end of both rods simultaneously using a candle or burner<br>
        4. Observe which wax pieces melt first<br>
        <br><strong>Observation:</strong> The wax on the metal rod melts quickly starting from the heated end and moving toward the other end. The wax on the wooden rod does not melt or melts very slowly.<br>
        <br><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This shows that heat travels quickly through metal (good conductor) but slowly through wood (poor conductor/insulator).<br>
        <em>Award marks for: definitions with examples (1.5), experiment procedure (1.5), observation and conclusion (1).</em>

    <div class="answer">
        <strong>14.</strong> <strong>Indicators:</strong><br>
        Indicators are substances that change color in acidic and basic solutions, helping us identify whether a solution is acidic or basic.<br>
        <br><strong>Using Litmus Paper:</strong><br>
        Litmus paper comes in two types: red litmus and blue litmus.<br>
        <br><strong>Testing procedure and color changes:</strong><br>
        <br>1. <strong>For Acidic Solution:</strong><br>
        • Dip blue litmus paper in the solution<br>
        • Blue litmus turns RED in acidic solution<br>
        • Red litmus remains red (no change)<br>
        <br>2. <strong>For Basic Solution:</strong><br>
        • Dip red litmus paper in the solution<br>
        • Red litmus turns BLUE in basic solution<br>
        • Blue litmus remains blue (no change)<br>
        <br>3. <strong>For Neutral Solution:</strong><br>
        • Neither red nor blue litmus paper changes color<br>
        • Both litmus papers retain their original colors<br>
        <br><em>Award marks for: definition of indicators (1), testing method (1), color changes for all three types (2).</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>15.</strong> <strong>Soil Erosion:</strong><br>
        Soil erosion is the removal and transport of topsoil (the fertile upper layer) from one place to another by natural agents like wind, water, and ice.<br>
        <br><strong>How it occurs:</strong><br>
        • Running water carries away topsoil, especially on slopes and during heavy rains<br>
        • Strong winds blow away loose topsoil, particularly in dry areas<br>
        • Deforestation removes tree roots that hold soil together<br>
        • Overgrazing by animals destroys vegetation cover<br>
        <br><strong>Harmful Effects:</strong><br>
        1. Loss of fertile topsoil reduces soil productivity<br>
        2. Leads to desertification in severe cases<br>
        3. Causes landslides in hilly areas<br>
        4. Siltation of rivers and reservoirs<br>
        5. Loss of biodiversity<br>
        <br><strong>Methods to Prevent Soil Erosion (any three):</strong><br>
        1. <strong>Afforestation:</strong> Planting more trees - roots bind the soil and prevent erosion<br>
        2. <strong>Terrace farming:</strong> Creating steps on slopes to slow down water flow<br>
        3. <strong>Contour plowing:</strong> Plowing along the contours of slopes to reduce water runoff<br>
        4. <strong>Building embankments:</strong> Constructing walls along rivers to prevent flooding and erosion<br>
        5. <strong>Controlled grazing:</strong> Preventing overgrazing to maintain vegetation cover<br>
        6. <strong>Shelter belts:</strong> Planting rows of trees to act as windbreaks<br>
        <br><em>Award marks for: definition and how it occurs (1), harmful effects (1), three prevention methods with brief explanations (2).</em>
