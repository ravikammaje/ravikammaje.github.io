    <h2>Section C: Long Answer Questions (20 Marks)</h2>
    
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>11.</strong> The Water Cycle:<br>
        The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface.<br>
        • <strong>Evaporation:</strong> The sun heats water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into water vapor (gas) that rises into the air.<br>
        • <strong>Condensation:</strong> As water vapor rises and cools in the atmosphere, it turns back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.<br>
        • <strong>Precipitation:</strong> When clouds become heavy with water droplets, the water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail.<br>
        The cycle then repeats as this water flows into water bodies or seeps into the ground.<br>
        <em>Award full marks for mentioning all three processes with explanations.</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>12.</strong> Life Cycle of a Butterfly:<br>
        A butterfly goes through four stages, called complete metamorphosis:<br>
        1. <strong>Egg:</strong> The butterfly lays tiny eggs on leaves.<br>
        2. <strong>Larva (Caterpillar):</strong> The egg hatches into a caterpillar that eats leaves and grows.<br>
        3. <strong>Pupa (Chrysalis):</strong> The caterpillar forms a hard covering around itself and undergoes transformation inside.<br>
        4. <strong>Adult Butterfly:</strong> The adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis with wings and can fly and reproduce.<br>
        <em>Award marks for mentioning all four stages with brief descriptions.</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>13.</strong> Difference between Weather and Climate:<br>
        • <strong>Weather</strong> refers to the atmospheric conditions at a particular place and time. It can change from day to day or even hour to hour.<br>
        Example: Today it is sunny and warm, but tomorrow it might rain.<br>
        • <strong>Climate</strong> is the average weather pattern of a place over a long period of time (usually 30 years or more).<br>
