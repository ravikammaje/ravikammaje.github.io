                <div class="answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Archimedes' Principle states that when a body is immersed wholly or partially in a fluid, it experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Mathematically, Buoyant Force (Fb) = ρ × V × g, where ρ is the density of fluid, V is volume of fluid displaced, and g is acceleration due to gravity.</div>

                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher water concentration (dilute solution) to a region of lower water concentration (concentrated solution) through a semipermeable membrane. Example: Absorption of water by plant roots from the soil, or raisins swelling when placed in water.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q1. Describe the structure of an animal cell with a well-labelled diagram. Explain the functions of any five cell organelles.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>An animal cell is a eukaryotic cell bounded by a plasma membrane. It contains various organelles suspended in the cytoplasm. Key structures include: nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, ribosomes, lysosomes, and centrioles. Functions of five organelles: (1) Nucleus: Contains genetic material (DNA) and controls all cell activities. It has a nuclear membrane with pores and contains the nucleolus. (2) Mitochondria: Known as the powerhouse of the cell. It performs cellular respiration and produces ATP (energy currency). Has a double membrane with inner folds called cristae. (3) Endoplasmic Reticulum: Rough ER has ribosomes and synthesizes proteins. Smooth ER synthesizes lipids and detoxifies harmful substances. (4) Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, packages, and dispatches proteins and lipids. Forms lysosomes and secretory vesicles. (5) Lysosomes: Contain digestive enzymes that break down worn-out organelles, food particles, and foreign materials. Called 'suicidal bags' of the cell.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q2. State Ohm's Law. Derive the relation between resistance, resistivity, length, and area of cross-section of a conductor. A wire of resistance 10 Ω is stretched to double its length. What will be its new resistance?</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Ohm's Law: At constant temperature, the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends. Mathematically, V = IR, where V is potential difference, I is current, and R is resistance. Derivation: Resistance of a conductor depends on: (i) Length (l) - R ∝ l, (ii) Area of cross-section (A) - R ∝ 1/A, (iii) Nature of material. Combining: R ∝ l/A, therefore R = ρl/A, where ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material (SI unit: Ω·m). Numerical: Original resistance R₁ = 10 Ω. When wire is stretched to double length, new length l₂ = 2l₁. Volume remains constant: A₁l₁ = A₂l₂, so A₂ = A₁l₁/2l₁ = A₁/2. New resistance R₂ = ρl₂/A₂ = ρ(2l₁)/(A₁/2) = 4ρl₁/A₁ = 4R₁ = 4 × 10 = 40 Ω. The new resistance is 40 Ω.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q3. What is the law of conservation of mass? Verify this law using the reaction between barium chloride and sodium sulphate solutions. Write the balanced equation.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Law of Conservation of Mass: Matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. The total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products. Verification Experiment: Take a solution of barium chloride (BaCl₂) in one beaker and sodium sulphate (Na₂SO₄) solution in another. Weigh both beakers together (let it be M₁ grams). Mix the two solutions. A white precipitate of barium sulphate (BaSO₄) is formed. Weigh the mixture after the reaction (let it be M₂ grams). Observation: M₁ = M₂, confirming the law. Balanced Chemical Equation: BaCl₂(aq) + Na₂SO₄(aq) → BaSO₄(s)↓ + 2NaCl(aq). This is a double displacement reaction. The white precipitate formed is barium sulphate which is insoluble in water. The mass remains constant because atoms are merely rearranged, not created or destroyed.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q4. Explain the phenomenon of reflection of sound. What are echoes? Calculate the minimum distance required to hear an echo if the speed of sound in air is 340 m/s.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Reflection of Sound: When sound waves strike a surface, they bounce back into the same medium. This is called reflection of sound. The laws of reflection apply: (1) The incident sound wave, reflected sound wave, and normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane. (2) The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Echo: An echo is the repetition of sound caused by the reflection of sound waves from a distant obstacle like a cliff, building, or wall. For an echo to be heard distinctly, the reflected sound must reach the ear at least 0.1 seconds after the original sound (persistence of hearing). Calculation: Time required = 0.1 s, Speed of sound = 340 m/s. Total distance travelled by sound = speed × time = 340 × 0.1 = 34 m. Since sound travels to the obstacle and back, minimum distance of obstacle = 34/2 = 17 m. Therefore, the minimum distance required to hear an echo is 17 meters.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q5. Describe the structure of an atom according to Bohr's model. How does it explain the stability of atoms? Calculate the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in ³⁵Cl¹⁷.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Bohr's Model of Atom (1913): (1) An atom consists of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus containing protons and neutrons. (2) Electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits called energy levels or shells (K, L, M, N...). (3) Each orbit has a fixed energy. Electrons in a particular orbit have constant energy. (4) Electrons can jump from one orbit to another by absorbing or emitting energy equal to the difference between the two energy levels (E₂ - E₁ = hν). (5) The maximum number of electrons in a shell is given by 2n², where n is the shell number. Stability Explanation: Electrons revolving in fixed orbits do not radiate energy. They remain stable as long as they stay in their designated orbits. Energy is only exchanged during transitions between orbits, not during revolution in the same orbit. This explains why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus. Calculation for ³⁵Cl¹⁷: Mass number (A) = 35, Atomic number (Z) = 17. Number of protons = Atomic number = 17. Number of electrons = Number of protons = 17 (for neutral atom). Number of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number = 35 - 17 = 18. Electronic configuration: 2, 8, 7.</div>
