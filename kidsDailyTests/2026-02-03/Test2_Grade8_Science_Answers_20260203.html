                <span class="question-text">Q1. Describe the structure and function of the human heart. Explain the process of blood circulation through the heart.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Structure of the Human Heart:
The human heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist, located slightly left of the center of the chest. It has four chambers:
1. Right Atrium - receives deoxygenated blood from the body
2. Right Ventricle - pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs
3. Left Atrium - receives oxygenated blood from the lungs
4. Left Ventricle - pumps oxygenated blood to the body

Valves present:
- Tricuspid valve (between right atrium and right ventricle)
- Bicuspid/Mitral valve (between left atrium and left ventricle)
- Pulmonary valve (between right ventricle and pulmonary artery)
- Aortic valve (between left ventricle and aorta)

Blood Circulation Process:

1. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cava.

2. Right atrium contracts, pushing blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.

3. Right ventricle contracts, sending deoxygenated blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs.

4. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is absorbed (gaseous exchange).

5. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.

6. Left atrium contracts, pushing blood through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle.

7. Left ventricle (the strongest chamber) contracts and pumps oxygenated blood through the aortic valve into the aorta.

8. The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body.

This is called double circulation because blood passes through the heart twice in one complete cycle - once through the right side (pulmonary circulation) and once through the left side (systemic circulation).</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q2. Explain the different types of chemical reactions with examples and balanced equations for each.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Types of Chemical Reactions:

1. COMBINATION REACTION (Synthesis):
Two or more substances combine to form a single product.
Example: Magnesium burns in oxygen to form magnesium oxide.
2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO

2. DECOMPOSITION REACTION:
A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.
Example: Heating calcium carbonate produces calcium oxide and carbon dioxide.
CaCO₃ → (heat) → CaO + CO₂

3. DISPLACEMENT REACTION (Single Displacement):
A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound.
Example: Zinc displaces copper from copper sulfate solution.
Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu

4. DOUBLE DISPLACEMENT REACTION:
Two compounds exchange their ions to form two new compounds.
Example: Silver nitrate reacts with sodium chloride.
AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl↓ + NaNO₃

5. NEUTRALIZATION REACTION:
An acid reacts with a base to form salt and water.
Example: Hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide.
HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O

6. COMBUSTION REACTION:
A substance reacts rapidly with oxygen, releasing heat and light.
Example: Burning of methane (natural gas).
CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + Heat

7. OXIDATION-REDUCTION (Redox) REACTION:
Reactions involving transfer of electrons - oxidation (loss of electrons) and reduction (gain of electrons) occur simultaneously.
Example: Rusting of iron.
4Fe + 3O₂ + 6H₂O → 4Fe(OH)₃
Iron is oxidized, oxygen is reduced.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q3. What is pressure? Derive the formula for pressure exerted by a liquid column. Calculate the pressure at a depth of 15 m below the surface of a lake. (Take density of water = 1000 kg/m³ and g = 10 m/s²)</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Definition of Pressure:
Pressure is defined as the force acting perpendicularly on a unit area of a surface.
Pressure (P) = Force (F) / Area (A)
SI unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa) or N/m²

Derivation of Liquid Pressure Formula:

Consider a liquid of density 'ρ' in a container. We need to find the pressure at a depth 'h' below the surface.

Consider a horizontal surface of area 'A' at depth 'h'.

Volume of liquid column above this surface = A × h

Mass of liquid column = Volume × Density
m = A × h × ρ

Weight of liquid column = Mass × Acceleration due to gravity
W = m × g = A × h × ρ × g

This weight acts as force on the surface of area A.

Pressure = Force / Area
P = W / A
P = (A × h × ρ × g) / A
P = hρg

Therefore, Pressure due to liquid column = hρg

This shows that liquid pressure:
- Increases with depth (h)
- Increases with density (ρ)
- Depends on gravitational acceleration (g)
- Is independent of the shape of the container

Numerical Calculation:
Given:
Depth (h) = 15 m
Density of water (ρ) = 1000 kg/m³
Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 10 m/s²

Pressure due to water = hρg
P = 15 × 1000 × 10
P = 150,000 Pa
P = 1.5 × 10⁵ Pa or 150 kPa

Therefore, the pressure at a depth of 15 m is 1.5 × 10⁵ Pa or 150 kPa.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q4. Explain the process of reproduction in flowering plants. Describe the structure of a flower and the events of pollination and fertilization.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Reproduction in Flowering Plants:

Flowering plants reproduce sexually through flowers. The flower is the reproductive organ.

Structure of a Flower:

1. SEPALS (Calyx): Green, leaf-like outer parts that protect the flower bud.

2. PETALS (Corolla): Colorful parts that attract pollinators like insects and birds.

3. STAMENS (Male reproductive part):
   - Anther: Produces pollen grains containing male gametes
   - Filament: Stalk that supports the anther

4. PISTIL/CARPEL (Female reproductive part):
   - Stigma: Sticky top surface that receives pollen
   - Style: Tube connecting stigma to ovary
   - Ovary: Contains ovules with female gametes (egg cells)

POLLINATION:
Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma.

Types of Pollination:
1. Self-pollination: Transfer of pollen from anther to stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant.
2. Cross-pollination: Transfer of pollen from anther of one flower to stigma of another flower on a different plant of the same species.

Agents of Pollination:
- Wind (anemophily)
- Insects (entomophily)
- Water (hydrophily)
- Birds (ornithophily)

FERTILIZATION:

1. After pollination, the pollen grain lands on the stigma.

2. The pollen grain absorbs moisture and nutrients, then germinates.

3. A pollen tube grows from the pollen grain, down through the style toward the ovary.

4. The pollen tube carries two male gametes (sperm nuclei).

5. The pollen tube enters the ovule through a small opening called micropyle.

6. Double Fertilization occurs (unique to flowering plants):
   - One male gamete fuses with the egg cell to form the zygote (2n), which develops into the embryo.
   - The other male gamete fuses with two polar nuclei to form the endosperm nucleus (3n), which develops into endosperm (food storage tissue).

7. After fertilization:
   - Ovule develops into seed
   - Ovary develops into fruit
   - Other flower parts wither and fall off</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q5. Describe Newton's three laws of motion. Give two examples from daily life for each law.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>NEWTON'S THREE LAWS OF MOTION:

FIRST LAW OF MOTION (Law of Inertia):

Statement: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.

This law defines inertia - the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion.

Daily Life Examples:
1. When a bus suddenly starts moving, passengers fall backward because their bodies tend to remain at rest due to inertia.
2. When you shake a wet umbrella, water droplets fly off because they tend to continue moving when the umbrella suddenly stops.

SECOND LAW OF MOTION (Law of Acceleration):

Statement: The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the unbalanced force applied and takes place in the direction of the force.

Mathematically: F = ma
Where F = Force, m = mass, a = acceleration

This law gives a quantitative measure of force.

Daily Life Examples:
1. A cricket player moves his hands backward while catching a fast ball - this increases the time of impact, reducing the force and preventing injury.
2. It is easier to push an empty shopping cart than a full one - the same force produces less acceleration in a more massive object.

THIRD LAW OF MOTION (Action-Reaction Law):

Statement: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Action and reaction forces act on different bodies.

Mathematically: F₁₂ = -F₂₁

Daily Life Examples:
1. While walking, we push the ground backward with our feet (action), and the ground pushes us forward (reaction), enabling us to move.
2. A rocket moves forward by expelling hot gases backward at high speed - the gases exert a forward force on the rocket (reaction) equal to the backward force exerted by the rocket on the gases (action).

Additional Observations:
- First law is a special case of second law (when F = 0, a = 0)
- Third law explains that forces always occur in pairs
- These laws form the foundation of classical mechanics
- They apply to objects moving at speeds much less than the speed of light</div>
