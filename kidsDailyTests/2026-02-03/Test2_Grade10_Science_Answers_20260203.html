                <div class="answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Reflex action is an automatic, quick, and involuntary response to a stimulus without the conscious involvement of the brain. Examples include withdrawal of hand when touching a hot object, blinking of eyes. A reflex arc consists of: (1) Receptor - sensory organ that detects stimulus, (2) Sensory neuron - carries impulse from receptor to spinal cord, (3) Relay neuron - in spinal cord, connects sensory and motor neurons, (4) Motor neuron - carries impulse from spinal cord to effector, (5) Effector - muscle or gland that responds.</div>

                <div class="answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Ohm's Law: At constant temperature, the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends. V = IR. When wire is stretched to twice its length: New length l' = 2l. Volume remains constant, so A' × l' = A × l, giving A' = A/2. New resistance R' = ρl'/A' = ρ(2l)/(A/2) = 4ρl/A = 4R = 4 × 20 = 80Ω</div>

                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>A homologous series is a group of organic compounds having similar chemical properties and the same functional group, with successive members differing by a CH₂ unit. Characteristics: (1) All members have the same general formula (e.g., alkanes: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂), (2) Successive members differ by CH₂ (14 u in molecular mass), (3) All members have similar chemical properties, (4) Physical properties show a gradual change with increase in molecular mass. Example: Methane (CH₄), Ethane (C₂H₆), Propane (C₃H₈) - all are alkanes.</div>

                <div class="answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>During day, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, it gets scattered by air molecules. Blue light has shorter wavelength and is scattered more than red light (Rayleigh scattering). This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue. At sunrise/sunset, sunlight travels a longer path through the atmosphere. Most of the blue light is scattered away before reaching us, and only red light with longer wavelength (which is scattered least) reaches our eyes, giving the sky a red/orange appearance.</div>

                <div class="answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Electroplating is the process of depositing a layer of one metal over another metal by passing electric current through an electrolyte solution containing the salt of the metal to be deposited. The object to be plated is made the cathode, and the plating metal is made the anode. Applications: (1) Chromium plating on iron parts of cars, bicycles to prevent rusting and provide shine, (2) Silver plating on brass utensils for decorative purposes, (3) Tin plating on iron to make tin cans for food preservation, (4) Gold plating on jewellery for attractive appearance.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q1. (a) Draw a labelled diagram of the human excretory system. (b) Describe the structure and function of a nephron. (c) Name the two major steps involved in the formation of urine.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>(a) The human excretory system diagram should include: Two kidneys (bean-shaped organs on either side of vertebral column), two ureters (tubes connecting kidneys to urinary bladder), urinary bladder (muscular sac that stores urine), urethra (tube through which urine is expelled), renal artery (brings blood to kidney), renal vein (takes filtered blood away from kidney), adrenal gland (on top of each kidney). (b) Nephron Structure: A nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons. Parts include: (1) Bowman's capsule - cup-shaped structure containing glomerulus, (2) Glomerulus - network of capillaries where filtration occurs, (3) Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) - coiled tube where reabsorption of glucose, amino acids, and salts occurs, (4) Loop of Henle - U-shaped tube that maintains salt and water balance, (5) Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT) - where tubular secretion and final adjustments occur, (6) Collecting duct - collects urine from multiple nephrons. Function: Filtration of blood, reabsorption of useful substances, and secretion of waste products. (c) Two major steps in urine formation: (1) Ultrafiltration/Glomerular filtration - blood is filtered under high pressure in the glomerulus; all small molecules (water, glucose, salts, urea) pass into Bowman's capsule while blood cells and proteins remain in blood. (2) Selective reabsorption - useful substances like glucose, amino acids, and required water and salts are reabsorbed back into blood capillaries surrounding the tubules. Additional step: Tubular secretion - additional waste products are secreted from blood into the tubule.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q2. (a) What is electromagnetic induction? State Faraday's laws of electromagnetic induction. (b) Explain the principle and working of an AC generator with a labelled diagram. (c) Write two differences between AC and DC.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>(a) Electromagnetic Induction: The phenomenon of producing an induced EMF (and hence induced current) in a conductor due to changing magnetic flux linked with it is called electromagnetic induction. Faraday's Laws: First Law - Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes, an EMF is induced in it. The induced EMF lasts as long as the change in magnetic flux continues. Second Law - The magnitude of induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linked with the circuit. e = -dφ/dt (b) AC Generator Principle: Based on electromagnetic induction. When a coil rotates in a magnetic field, the magnetic flux through it changes, inducing an EMF. Construction (diagram should show): (1) Armature - rectangular coil of insulated copper wire, (2) Field magnets - strong permanent magnets or electromagnets providing magnetic field, (3) Slip rings - two metal rings connected to ends of coil, rotate with coil, (4) Brushes - carbon brushes in contact with slip rings, connected to external circuit. Working: When the armature rotates in the magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked with it changes continuously. According to Faraday's law, an EMF is induced. As the coil rotates through different positions, the EMF varies sinusoidally. In one half rotation, current flows in one direction; in the next half, it reverses. This produces alternating current. EMF equation: e = e₀ sin ωt, where e₀ = NBAω (maximum EMF). (c) Differences between AC and DC: (1) AC changes direction periodically while DC flows in one direction only, (2) AC can be easily stepped up or down using transformers while DC cannot be transformed directly, (3) AC can be transmitted over long distances with less energy loss while DC transmission has more losses, (4) AC is generated by alternators while DC is generated by DC generators or cells.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q3. (a) What are the different types of chemical reactions? Give one example of each. (b) Balance the following chemical equation and identify the type of reaction: Fe₂O₃ + Al → Al₂O₃ + Fe (c) What is a redox reaction? Identify the oxidizing and reducing agents in the above reaction.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>(a) Types of Chemical Reactions: (1) Combination/Synthesis Reaction - Two or more substances combine to form a single product. Example: 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO. (2) Decomposition Reaction - A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. Example: 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂ (electrolysis). (3) Displacement/Single Replacement Reaction - A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound. Example: Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu. (4) Double Displacement Reaction - Exchange of ions between two compounds. Example: NaCl + AgNO₃ → AgCl + NaNO₃. (5) Combustion Reaction - Substance reacts with oxygen releasing heat and light. Example: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O. (6) Neutralization Reaction - Acid reacts with base to form salt and water. Example: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O. (b) Balanced equation: Fe₂O₃ + 2Al → Al₂O₃ + 2Fe. Type of reaction: This is a displacement reaction (specifically a thermite reaction). It is also a redox reaction. (c) Redox Reaction: A chemical reaction in which both oxidation (loss of electrons/gain of oxygen) and reduction (gain of electrons/loss of oxygen) occur simultaneously is called a redox reaction. In the reaction Fe₂O₃ + 2Al → Al₂O₃ + 2Fe: Oxidation: Al → Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ (Aluminium loses electrons, gets oxidized). Reduction: Fe³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Fe (Iron gains electrons, gets reduced). Oxidizing Agent: Fe₂O₃ (iron oxide) - it provides oxygen to aluminium and itself gets reduced. Reducing Agent: Al (aluminium) - it removes oxygen from iron oxide and itself gets oxidized.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q4. (a) Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of image of an object placed between F and 2F of a convex lens. (b) A concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should the object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm from the lens? Also find the magnification produced. (c) State any two differences between a real and a virtual image.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>(a) Ray diagram for object between F and 2F of convex lens: Draw principal axis, convex lens at centre, mark F and 2F on both sides. Place object (arrow) between F and 2F on left side. Draw three rays: (1) Ray parallel to principal axis - refracts through F on other side, (2) Ray through optical centre - passes undeviated, (3) Ray through F - emerges parallel to principal axis. The rays converge on the other side beyond 2F. Image characteristics: Real, inverted, magnified, formed beyond 2F on the other side. (b) Given: Concave lens, f = -15 cm (negative for concave lens), v = -10 cm (image is always virtual and on same side as object for concave lens). Using lens formula: 1/v - 1/u = 1/f. 1/(-10) - 1/u = 1/(-15). -1/10 - 1/u = -1/15. -1/u = -1/15 + 1/10 = (-2 + 3)/30 = 1/30. u = -30 cm. The object should be placed 30 cm from the lens on the same side. Magnification m = v/u = (-10)/(-30) = 1/3 = 0.33. The image is virtual, erect, and diminished (1/3 the size of object). (c) Differences between Real and Virtual Image: (1) Real image is formed by actual intersection of light rays while virtual image is formed by apparent intersection of light rays when extended backwards. (2) Real image can be obtained on a screen while virtual image cannot be obtained on a screen. (3) Real image is always inverted while virtual image is always erect. (4) Real image is formed on the opposite side of the lens/mirror from the object while virtual image is formed on the same side as the object (for mirrors) or same side for diverging lens.</div>

Explain any two defects and their correction. (c) A person cannot see objects clearly beyond 50 cm. What kind of defect is this and what type of lens should be used to correct it? Calculate the power of the lens required.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>(a) Structure of Human Eye (diagram should show cross-section): (1) Cornea - transparent front covering that refracts light entering the eye. (2) Aqueous humour - clear fluid between cornea and lens. (3) Iris - coloured muscular diaphragm that controls size of pupil. (4) Pupil - opening in iris that regulates amount of light entering. (5) Crystalline lens - biconvex, flexible lens that focuses light on retina. (6) Ciliary muscles - muscles that change shape of lens for accommodation. (7) Vitreous humour - jelly-like substance filling the eyeball. (8) Retina - screen at back of eye containing photoreceptors (rods and cones). (9) Optic nerve - carries visual information to brain. (10) Blind spot - point where optic nerve connects, no photoreceptors. (11) Yellow spot/Macula - area of most distinct vision. (b) Defects of Vision: (1) Myopia (Short-sightedness): Person can see nearby objects clearly but distant objects appear blurred. Cause: Eyeball is too long or lens is too curved, image forms in front of retina. Correction: Concave lens of appropriate focal length is used to diverge light rays before entering the eye, so image forms on retina. (2) Hypermetropia (Long-sightedness): Person can see distant objects clearly but nearby objects appear blurred. Cause: Eyeball is too short or lens is too flat, image forms behind retina. Correction: Convex lens is used to converge light rays so that image forms on retina. (3) Presbyopia: Age-related defect where ciliary muscles weaken, reducing accommodation. Corrected using bifocal lenses. (4) Astigmatism: Irregular curvature of cornea causing blurred vision. Corrected using cylindrical lenses. (c) The person cannot see objects clearly beyond 50 cm, meaning far point is 50 cm instead of infinity. This is Myopia (short-sightedness). A concave lens is needed to correct this defect. For correction, the lens should form a virtual image of distant object (at infinity) at the far point (50 cm). u = ∞ (object at infinity), v = -50 cm (image at far point, negative as virtual image on same side). Using lens formula: 1/f = 1/v - 1/u = 1/(-50) - 1/∞ = -1/50. f = -50 cm = -0.5 m. Power P = 1/f = 1/(-0.5) = -2 D. A concave lens of power -2 dioptres (or focal length -50 cm) is required.</div>
