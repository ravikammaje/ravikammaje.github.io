                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>In ethene, each carbon atom undergoes sp² hybridization. The 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals hybridize to form three sp² hybrid orbitals arranged in a trigonal planar geometry at 120°. Each carbon uses two sp² orbitals to form σ bonds with two hydrogen atoms and one sp² orbital to form a σ bond with the other carbon. The unhybridized p orbital on each carbon overlaps laterally to form one π bond. Thus, ethene has a C=C double bond consisting of one σ bond and one π bond, plus four C-H σ bonds.</div>

Faraday's Laws:
First Law: Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes, an EMF is induced in the circuit.

Second Law: The magnitude of the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage.
Mathematically: ε = -dΦ/dt

The negative sign indicates Lenz's law - the induced EMF opposes the change that produces it.</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q1. Describe the structure of DNA according to Watson and Crick's model. Explain how DNA replication occurs and why it is called semi-conservative.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Watson and Crick's DNA Model (1953):

1. Double Helix Structure:
- DNA consists of two polynucleotide chains coiled around a common axis forming a right-handed double helix
- The diameter of the helix is 2 nm (20 Å)
- One complete turn of the helix is 3.4 nm with 10 base pairs per turn
- Distance between adjacent base pairs is 0.34 nm

2. Sugar-Phosphate Backbone:
- The two strands run antiparallel (5'→3' and 3'→5')
- The backbone consists of alternating deoxyribose sugar and phosphate groups
- Phosphodiester bonds link the nucleotides

3. Base Pairing:
- Nitrogenous bases project inward from the backbone
- Adenine pairs with Thymine through 2 hydrogen bonds (A=T)
- Guanine pairs with Cytosine through 3 hydrogen bonds (G≡C)
- This is called complementary base pairing (Chargaff's rule)

4. Major and Minor Grooves:
- The helix has alternating major and minor grooves where proteins can bind

DNA Replication:

1. Initiation:
- Enzyme helicase unwinds the double helix at the origin of replication
- Single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) stabilize the separated strands
- Topoisomerase relieves tension ahead of the replication fork

2. Primer Synthesis:
- Primase synthesizes short RNA primers complementary to the template

3. Elongation:
- DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides in 5'→3' direction
- Leading strand: Continuous synthesis toward the replication fork
- Lagging strand: Discontinuous synthesis away from fork, forming Okazaki fragments

4. Primer Removal and Gap Filling:
- DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and fills gaps with DNA
- DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments

5. Termination:
- Replication ends when forks meet or reach terminus sequences

Semi-Conservative Replication:
Meselson and Stahl (1958) proved that DNA replication is semi-conservative using N¹⁵ (heavy) and N¹⁴ (light) isotopes of nitrogen.

- Each daughter DNA molecule contains one original (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand
- This is called semi-conservative because half of the parent molecule is conserved in each daughter molecule
- This ensures accurate transmission of genetic information with minimal errors
- The complementary base pairing ensures that each new strand is an exact copy of the original</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q2. Derive an expression for the electric field intensity at a point on the axial line of an electric dipole. Also derive the expression for the electric field at a point on the equatorial line.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Electric Dipole: Two equal and opposite charges +q and -q separated by a small distance 2a. Dipole moment p = q × 2a (direction from -q to +q).

A) Electric Field on Axial Line:

Consider point P at distance r from the center O on the axial line.
Distance of P from +q = (r - a)
Distance of P from -q = (r + a)

Electric field due to +q at P:
E₁ = kq/(r-a)² (away from +q, toward P)

Electric field due to -q at P:
E₂ = kq/(r+a)² (toward -q, away from P)

Net field E = E₁ - E₂ (since E₁ > E₂ and they're along the same line)

E = kq/(r-a)² - kq/(r+a)²
E = kq[(r+a)² - (r-a)²]/[(r-a)²(r+a)²]
E = kq[(r² + 2ar + a²) - (r² - 2ar + a²)]/(r² - a²)²
E = kq[4ar]/(r² - a²)²
E = 4kqar/(r² - a²)²

Since p = 2qa:
E = 2kpr/(r² - a²)²

For r >> a (far field approximation):
E_axial = 2kp/r³ = (1/4πε₀) × (2p/r³)

In vector form: E_axial = (2p)/(4πε₀r³) along the dipole axis

B) Electric Field on Equatorial Line:

Consider point P at distance r from center O on the equatorial line (perpendicular bisector).
Distance of P from both charges = √(r² + a²)

Magnitude of field due to each charge:
E₁ = E₂ = kq/(r² + a²)

The fields E₁ (due to +q) and E₂ (due to -q) make equal angles θ with the equatorial line, where:
cos θ = a/√(r² + a²)

Vertical components cancel out (equal and opposite).
Horizontal components add up (both point from +q toward -q).

Net field E = 2E₁ cos θ
E = 2 × [kq/(r² + a²)] × [a/√(r² + a²)]
E = 2kqa/(r² + a²)^(3/2)

Since p = 2qa:
E = kp/(r² + a²)^(3/2)

For r >> a:
E_equatorial = kp/r³ = p/(4πε₀r³)

In vector form: E_equatorial = -p/(4πε₀r³) (antiparallel to dipole moment)

Comparison:
- E_axial = 2 × E_equatorial (axial field is twice the equatorial field)
- Axial field is parallel to p; Equatorial field is antiparallel to p
- Both decrease as 1/r³ (faster than point charge field which decreases as 1/r²)</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q3. Explain the mechanism of SN1 and SN2 reactions with examples. Discuss the factors affecting these reactions.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions:

A) SN1 Mechanism (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular):

Mechanism (Two steps):
Step 1 - Ionization (slow, rate-determining):
R-X → R⁺ + X⁻
The C-X bond breaks heterolytically forming a carbocation.

Step 2 - Nucleophilic attack (fast):
R⁺ + Nu⁻ → R-Nu
Nucleophile attacks the planar carbocation.

Example: Hydrolysis of tert-butyl bromide
(CH₃)₃C-Br + H₂O → (CH₃)₃C-OH + HBr

Step 1: (CH₃)₃C-Br → (CH₃)₃C⁺ + Br⁻ (slow)
Step 2: (CH₃)₃C⁺ + H₂O → (CH₃)₃C-OH₂⁺ → (CH₃)₃C-OH + H⁺ (fast)

Characteristics:
- Rate = k[R-X] (first order, depends only on substrate)
- Proceeds via carbocation intermediate
- Carbocation is sp² hybridized, planar
- Racemization occurs (50:50 mixture of R and S if chiral center)
- Favored by: tertiary > secondary > primary substrates

B) SN2 Mechanism (Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular):

Mechanism (One step, concerted):
Nu⁻ + R-X → [Nu---R---X]‡ → Nu-R + X⁻

The nucleophile attacks from the back side (180°) while the leaving group departs simultaneously through a transition state.

Example: Reaction of methyl bromide with hydroxide
CH₃-Br + OH⁻ → CH₃-OH + Br⁻

The OH⁻ attacks the carbon from the opposite side of Br, forming a pentacoordinate transition state, then Br⁻ leaves.

Characteristics:
- Rate = k[R-X][Nu⁻] (second order, depends on both)
- No intermediate, single transition state
- Inversion of configuration (Walden inversion)
- Favored by: primary > secondary > tertiary substrates

Factors Affecting SN1 and SN2:

1. Structure of Substrate:
- SN1: 3° > 2° > 1° > CH₃ (carbocation stability)
- SN2: CH₃ > 1° > 2° > 3° (steric hindrance)

2. Nature of Nucleophile:
- SN1: Independent of nucleophile strength
- SN2: Strong nucleophiles favor SN2 (I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻)

3. Nature of Leaving Group:
- Both favor good leaving groups
- Good leaving groups: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻
- Weak bases are better leaving groups

4. Solvent Effects:
- SN1: Polar protic solvents favor (stabilize carbocation and leaving group)
- SN2: Polar aprotic solvents favor (don't solvate nucleophile, keeping it reactive)

5. Temperature:
- Higher temperature generally increases both reaction rates
- SN1 is more affected due to higher activation energy for carbocation formation</div>

                <span class="question-text">Q4. Derive the expression for pressure exerted by an ideal gas using kinetic theory. State the assumptions of kinetic theory of gases.</span>
                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Assumptions of Kinetic Theory of Gases:

1. A gas consists of a very large number of molecules (N) in random motion
2. Gas molecules are identical, perfectly elastic, rigid spheres
3. The size of molecules is negligible compared to the average distance between them
4. Molecules exert no forces on each other except during collisions
5. Collisions between molecules and with container walls are perfectly elastic
6. Time of collision is negligible compared to time between collisions
7. Molecules obey Newton's laws of motion
8. The distribution of molecular speeds follows Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

Derivation of Pressure:

Consider an ideal gas enclosed in a cubic container of side L.
Let there be N molecules, each of mass m.
Let a molecule have velocity components (vₓ, vᵧ, vᵤ).

Step 1 - Momentum change during collision with wall:
Consider a molecule moving with x-component vₓ toward the wall perpendicular to x-axis.
Initial momentum = mvₓ
Final momentum (after elastic collision) = -mvₓ
Change in momentum = mvₓ - (-mvₓ) = 2mvₓ

Step 2 - Time between successive collisions:
After hitting the wall, the molecule travels to the opposite wall and back.
Distance traveled = 2L
Time between collisions = 2L/vₓ

Step 3 - Force by one molecule:
Force = Rate of change of momentum
F₁ = Δp/Δt = 2mvₓ/(2L/vₓ) = mvₓ²/L

Step 4 - Force by all molecules:
Total force on one wall = Σ(mvₓᵢ²/L) = (m/L)Σvₓᵢ²
If v̄ₓ² is the mean square velocity in x-direction:
Total force F = Nm(v̄ₓ²)/L

Step 5 - Relation between velocity components:
For random motion: v̄ₓ² = v̄ᵧ² = v̄ᵤ²
Also, v² = vₓ² + vᵧ² + vᵤ² (by Pythagoras)
Therefore, v̄² = v̄ₓ² + v̄ᵧ² + v̄ᵤ² = 3v̄ₓ²
So, v̄ₓ² = v̄²/3

Step 6 - Pressure calculation:
Pressure P = Force/Area = F/L²
P = Nm(v̄ₓ²)/(L × L²) = Nm(v̄ₓ²)/L³

Since volume V = L³ and v̄ₓ² = v̄²/3:
P = Nm(v̄²/3)/V

P = (1/3)(Nm/V)v̄²

Or: P = (1/3)ρv̄² where ρ = Nm/V is density

Alternative forms:
PV = (1/3)Nmv̄²
PV = (2/3)N × (1/2)mv̄²
PV = (2/3)N × (Average KE)
PV = (2/3)E_total

Since PV = nRT (ideal gas equation) and E = (3/2)nRT:
Average KE per molecule = (3/2)kT where k = R/Nₐ is Boltzmann constant

Root mean square speed: vᵣₘₛ = √v̄² = √(3RT/M) = √(3kT/m)</div>

                <div class="la-answer-space"></div>
                <div class="answer-key">📝 Solution:<br>Photosynthesis: The process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.

Overall Equation:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Site: Chloroplasts (specifically thylakoids for light reactions and stroma for dark reactions)

Role of Chlorophyll:
- Primary photosynthetic pigment located in thylakoid membranes
- Chlorophyll a (blue-green) - primary pigment, directly participates in light reactions
- Chlorophyll b (yellow-green) - accessory pigment, transfers energy to chlorophyll a
- Absorbs red (680nm, 700nm) and blue (450nm) light, reflects green
- Contains Mg²⁺ at center of porphyrin ring
- Organized in photosystems (PS I and PS II) with antenna complexes

I. LIGHT-DEPENDENT REACTIONS (Thylakoid Membranes):

A) Photosystem II (P680):
1. Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll a (P680)
2. Excited electrons are captured by primary electron acceptor
3. Water molecules are split (photolysis):
   2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂
4. Electrons from water replace those lost from P680
5. O₂ is released as byproduct
6. H⁺ ions accumulate in thylakoid lumen

B) Electron Transport Chain:
1. Electrons pass through plastoquinone (PQ), cytochrome b6f complex, plastocyanin (PC)
2. Energy released pumps H⁺ into thylakoid lumen
3. Creates proton gradient (chemiosmosis)

C) Photosystem I (P700):
1. Light excites electrons in P700
2. Electrons from PS II (via plastocyanin) replace those lost
3. Excited electrons pass through ferredoxin
4. NADP⁺ reductase catalyzes:
   NADP⁺ + 2e⁻ + H⁺ → NADPH

D) ATP Synthesis (Photophosphorylation):
1. H⁺ gradient drives ATP synthase
2. ADP + Pi → ATP (chemiosmotic phosphorylation)
3. Cyclic photophosphorylation: Only PS I, produces only ATP
4. Non-cyclic: Both PS I and II, produces ATP and NADPH

Products of Light Reactions:
- ATP (energy currency)
- NADPH (reducing power)
- O₂ (released to atmosphere)

II. LIGHT-INDEPENDENT REACTIONS (Calvin Cycle/C3 Cycle) - Stroma:

Discovered by Melvin Calvin using C¹⁴ labeled CO₂.

Phase 1 - Carbon Fixation:
- CO₂ combines with 5-carbon RuBP (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate)
- Enzyme: RuBisCO (Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase)
- Forms unstable 6-carbon compound that splits into two 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) molecules
- 3CO₂ + 3RuBP → 6 molecules of 3-PGA

Phase 2 - Reduction:
- 3-PGA is phosphorylated using ATP:
  3-PGA + ATP → 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate + ADP
- Reduced using NADPH:
  1,3-bisphosphoglycerate + NADPH → G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) + NADP⁺
- 6 ATP and 6 NADPH used to convert 6 molecules of 3-PGA to 6 G3P

Phase 3 - Regeneration of RuBP:
- Of 6 G3P molecules formed, 1 exits the cycle (net gain)
- 5 G3P molecules (15 carbons) are rearranged to regenerate 3 RuBP (15 carbons)
- Uses 3 ATP for phosphorylation

Phase 4 - Carbohydrate Synthesis:
- Two G3P molecules combine to form one glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)
- Glucose can form starch, cellulose, or enter respiration

Summary of Calvin Cycle (per 3 CO₂ fixed):
Inputs: 3 CO₂, 9 ATP, 6 NADPH
Outputs: 1 G3P (net), 9 ADP + 9 Pi, 6 NADP⁺

For one glucose molecule: 6 CO₂, 18 ATP, 12 NADPH required

Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:
1. Light intensity (increases rate up to saturation point)
2. CO₂ concentration (limiting factor at low levels)
3. Temperature (optimum 25-35°C)
4. Water availability
5. Chlorophyll content</div>
