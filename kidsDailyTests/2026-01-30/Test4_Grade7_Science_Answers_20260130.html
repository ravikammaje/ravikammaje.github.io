            <p>1. Reflection of Light: <span class="subject-tag">Physics</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <p>a) Definitions:</p>
                <p>   - Incident ray: The ray of light that falls on the reflecting surface.</p>
                <p>   - Reflected ray: The ray of light that bounces back from the reflecting surface.</p>
                <p>   - Normal: A line perpendicular (at 90°) to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence.</p>
                <p>   - Angle of incidence: The angle between the incident ray and the normal.</p>
                <p>b) Diagram should show: Mirror surface, incident ray, reflected ray, normal, point of incidence, angle of incidence (i), angle of reflection (r).</p>
                <p>c) Laws of reflection:</p>
                <p>   1. The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane.</p>
                <p>   2. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (∠i = ∠r).</p>
                <p>d) A plane mirror has a smooth, polished surface that reflects all light rays in a regular, parallel manner (regular reflection). This forms a clear image. A wall has a rough surface that reflects light rays in different directions (diffuse/irregular reflection), so no clear image is formed.</p>

            <p>2. Separation of Mixtures: <span class="subject-tag">Chemistry</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <p>a) A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically combined and can be separated by physical methods. The components retain their individual properties.</p>
                <p>   Difference from compound: A compound is formed by chemical combination of elements in a fixed ratio, and the properties of the compound are different from its constituent elements. It can only be separated by chemical methods.</p>
                <p>b) Steps to separate sand and salt:</p>
                <p>   1. Add water to the mixture and stir well (salt dissolves, sand doesn't)</p>
                <p>   2. Filter the mixture (sand remains on filter paper, salt solution passes through)</p>
                <p>   3. Evaporate the salt solution by heating (water evaporates, salt remains)</p>
                <p>c) Principle of distillation: It is based on the difference in boiling points of liquids. When a mixture is heated, the liquid with the lower boiling point evaporates first, then condenses back to liquid form when cooled, thus separating from the other components.</p>
                <p>d) (i) Cream from milk: Centrifugation (or churning)</p>
                <p>   (ii) Different colored dyes from ink: Chromatography</p>

                <p>a) The nervous system is the organ system that controls and coordinates all activities of the body. It receives information, processes it, and produces responses.</p>
                <p>   Two main divisions: Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)</p>
                <p>b) Diagram should show the brain with labeled parts: Cerebrum (largest, on top), Cerebellum (at the back, below cerebrum), Medulla oblongata (lowest part, connecting to spinal cord)</p>
                <p>c) Functions:</p>
                <p>   (i) Cerebrum: Controls thinking, memory, reasoning, learning, emotions, intelligence, and voluntary actions. It also processes sensory information (sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch).</p>
                <p>   (ii) Cerebellum: Controls balance, posture, and coordination of voluntary muscle movements.</p>
                <p>   (iii) Medulla oblongata: Controls involuntary actions like breathing, heartbeat, swallowing, blood pressure, and digestion.</p>
                <p>d) A reflex action is an automatic, rapid, and involuntary response to a stimulus without conscious thought. It is controlled by the spinal cord.</p>
                <p>   Example: Pulling your hand away when you touch a hot object, blinking when something comes close to your eye, knee-jerk reflex.</p>

            <p>4. Metals and Non-Metals: <span class="subject-tag">Chemistry</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <p>a) Four physical properties of metals:</p>
                <p>   1. Lustrous (shiny) - have a metallic luster</p>
                <p>   2. Good conductors of heat and electricity</p>
                <p>   3. Malleable - can be beaten into thin sheets</p>
                <p>   4. Ductile - can be drawn into thin wires</p>
                <p>   (Also: Sonorous, high melting points, solid at room temperature except mercury)</p>
                <p>b) Four physical properties of non-metals:</p>
                <p>   1. Non-lustrous (dull appearance, except iodine and diamond)</p>
                <p>   2. Poor conductors of heat and electricity (except graphite)</p>
                <p>   3. Not malleable - brittle in solid state</p>
                <p>   4. Not ductile - cannot be drawn into wires</p>
                <p>   (Also: Low melting points, can be solid/liquid/gas at room temperature)</p>
                <p>c) Corrosion is the gradual destruction of metals by chemical reaction with their environment (air, water, chemicals). Rusting of iron occurs when iron reacts with oxygen and moisture (water) in the air. The chemical equation is:</p>
                <p>   4Fe + 3O<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O → 4Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> → 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O (rust)</p>
                <p>d) Two methods to prevent rusting:</p>
                <p>   1. Painting or oiling the iron surface (prevents contact with air and moisture)</p>
                <p>   2. Galvanization (coating iron with zinc)</p>
                <p>   (Also: Electroplating, alloying, keeping in dry conditions)</p>

            <p>5. Excretory System: <span class="subject-tag">Biology</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <p>a) Excretion is the process of removing metabolic waste products and excess substances from the body.</p>
                <p>   Importance: It removes toxic waste products like urea, carbon dioxide, and excess water from the body. If these wastes accumulate, they can poison the body and disrupt normal functioning.</p>
                <p>b) Main organs of the human excretory system:</p>
                <p>   1. Two kidneys</p>
                <p>   2. Two ureters</p>
                <p>   3. One urinary bladder</p>
                <p>   4. One urethra</p>
                <p>   (Also: Skin, lungs, and liver help in excretion)</p>
                <p>c) Diagram should show kidney with labels:</p>
                <p>   - Cortex (outer region)</p>
                <p>   - Medulla (inner region)</p>
                <p>   - Renal artery (bringing blood to kidney)</p>
                <p>   - Renal vein (taking blood away from kidney)</p>
                <p>   - Ureter (tube carrying urine to bladder)</p>
                <p>   - Pelvis (funnel-shaped area collecting urine)</p>
                <p>d) Functions of kidneys:</p>
                <p>   1. Filter blood to remove waste products</p>
                <p>   2. Regulate water balance in the body</p>
                <p>   3. Maintain electrolyte (salt) balance</p>
                <p>   4. Produce urine</p>
                <p>   Main waste product removed: Urea (formed from breakdown of proteins)</p>
                <p>   (Also: Excess water, salts, and other metabolic wastes)</p>
