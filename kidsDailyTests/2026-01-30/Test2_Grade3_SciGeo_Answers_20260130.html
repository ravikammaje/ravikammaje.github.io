            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <p>a) Three states of matter: Solid, Liquid, and Gas</p>
                <p>b) Liquids can be poured because they have no fixed shape - they take the shape of their container and their particles can flow past each other.</p>
                <p>c) Examples from home:</p>
                <p>   Solids: Table, chair, book, spoon, plate</p>
                <p>   Liquids: Water, milk, cooking oil, shampoo, juice</p>

                <p>b) Water Cycle Diagram should show:</p>
                <p>   - Evaporation: Water from oceans/rivers turns into water vapor due to Sun's heat</p>
                <p>   - Condensation: Water vapor cools and forms clouds</p>
                <p>   - Precipitation: Water falls back as rain, snow, or hail</p>
                <p>c) Importance of conserving water:</p>
                <p>   - Fresh water is limited on Earth</p>
                <p>   - Many people don't have access to clean water</p>
                <p>   - Water is needed for drinking, farming, and daily activities</p>
                <p>d) Ways to save water at home:</p>

            <p>4. The Globe and Directions: <span class="subject-tag">Geography</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <p>a) A globe is a spherical model of the Earth. It represents the shape of Earth and shows continents, oceans, and countries in their correct positions.</p>
                <p>b) We have day and night because Earth rotates (spins) on its axis. The side facing the Sun has day, and the side away from the Sun has night. Earth takes 24 hours to complete one rotation.</p>
                <p>c) The four main directions are called Cardinal Directions: North (N), South (S), East (E), West (W). A compass rose shows these directions with North at the top.</p>
                <p>d) If you face the rising Sun (East), your left side will face North.</p>

            <p>5. Changes in States of Matter: <span class="subject-tag">Science</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
                <p>a) Melting is the change from solid to liquid state when heat is added. Example: Ice melting into water, butter melting when heated.</p>
                <p>b) Evaporation is the change from liquid to gas state. Example: Water drying up from wet roads, puddles disappearing on a sunny day.</p>
                <p>c) Freezing is the change from liquid to solid state when cooled. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (or 32 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
                <p>d) Wet clothes dry when hung in the sun because the water in the clothes evaporates. The heat from the sun gives energy to water molecules, causing them to escape into the air as water vapor. This process is called evaporation.</p>
