        <h2>ANSWER KEY - GRADE 7 SCIENCE</h2>

        <h3>Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (10 marks)</h3>
        <p><strong>1. b) Lemon juice</strong><br>
        Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it acidic. Lime water and milk of magnesia are bases, while soap solution is also basic.</p>

        <p><strong>2. b) Transpiration</strong><br>
        Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water vapor through small pores called stomata, mainly present on leaves.</p>

        <p><strong>3. c) Newton</strong><br>
        The SI unit of force is Newton (N), named after Sir Isaac Newton. 1 Newton is the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass by 1 m/s².</p>

        <p><strong>4. c) Heart</strong><br>
        The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to all cells.</p>

        <p><strong>5. b) Physical change</strong><br>
        A physical change is reversible and does not form new substances. Examples: melting of ice, dissolving sugar in water.</p>

        <h3>Section B: Short Answer Questions (10 marks)</h3>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Any two from: Lever, Pulley, Inclined plane, Wheel and axle, Wedge, Screw<br>
        (Award 1 mark for each correct simple machine)</p>

        <p><strong>7.</strong> The small intestine absorbs digested food (nutrients) into the bloodstream. It also completes the digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats with the help of enzymes.<br>
        (Award full marks for mentioning absorption and/or completing digestion)</p>

        <p><strong>8.</strong> Conduction is the transfer of heat through a substance from a hot region to a cold region without any movement of the substance itself.<br>
        Example: A metal spoon becoming hot when placed in hot tea/soup.<br>
        (Accept other valid examples: heating of a metal rod, cooking in a pan, etc.)<br>
        (1 mark for definition, 1 mark for example)</p>

        <p><strong>9.</strong> Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone or vertebral column (e.g., humans, dogs, fish).<br>
        Invertebrates are animals that do not have a backbone (e.g., insects, worms, jellyfish).<br>
        (Award full marks for clearly stating the difference)</p>

        <p><strong>10.</strong> Oxygen (O₂)<br>
        Oxygen is released as a by-product during photosynthesis when plants make their food.</p>

        <h3>Section C: Long Answer Questions (20 marks)</h3>
        <p><strong>11.</strong> Photosynthesis (4 marks):<br>
        Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food using sunlight.<br>
        <strong>a) Raw materials required:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        - Carbon dioxide (CO₂) from air through stomata<br>
        - Water (H₂O) absorbed by roots from soil<br>
        - Sunlight as energy source<br>
        <strong>b) Products formed:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        - Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) - food/sugar<br>
        - Oxygen (O₂) - released into air<br>
        <strong>c) Importance of chlorophyll:</strong> (2 marks)<br>
        Chlorophyll is the green pigment present in leaves that captures sunlight energy. Without chlorophyll, plants cannot trap light energy needed to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. It is essential for photosynthesis to occur.</p>

        <p><strong>12.</strong> Methods of heat transfer (4 marks):<br>
        <strong>1. Conduction:</strong> (1-1.5 marks)<br>
        Heat transfer through direct contact between particles of a substance, without movement of the substance itself. Occurs mainly in solids.<br>
        Example: Metal spoon getting hot in hot tea, heating a metal rod from one end makes the other end hot.<br>
        <strong>2. Convection:</strong> (1-1.5 marks)<br>
        Heat transfer through actual movement of heated particles of a substance. Occurs in liquids and gases.<br>
        Example: Water heating in a pot (hot water rises, cold water sinks), land and sea breezes, room heating by heaters.<br>
        <strong>3. Radiation:</strong> (1-1.5 marks)<br>
        Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves without requiring any medium. Can occur through vacuum.<br>
        Example: Heat from the sun reaching Earth, feeling warmth near a fire, microwave oven heating food.</p>

        <p><strong>13.</strong> Aerobic vs Anaerobic Respiration (4 marks):<br>
        <strong>Differences:</strong> (2 marks)<br>
        <strong>Aerobic Respiration:</strong><br>
        - Occurs in presence of oxygen<br>
        - Complete breakdown of glucose<br>
        - Releases more energy (38 ATP molecules)<br>
        - Products: Carbon dioxide and water<br>
        - Occurs in mitochondria<br>
        <strong>Anaerobic Respiration:</strong><br>
        - Occurs in absence of oxygen<br>
        - Incomplete breakdown of glucose<br>
        - Releases less energy (2 ATP molecules)<br>
        - Products: Lactic acid (animals) or Ethanol and CO₂ (yeast/plants)<br>
        - Occurs in cytoplasm<br>
        <strong>Chemical equation for aerobic respiration:</strong> (2 marks)<br>
        C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (ATP)<br>
        Or in words: Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy</p>

        <p><strong>14.</strong> The Water Cycle (4 marks):<br>
        The water cycle is the continuous circulation of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface.<br>
        <strong>Main processes:</strong><br>
        <strong>1. Evaporation:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        Heat from the sun causes water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other water bodies to change into water vapor (gas). This water vapor rises into the atmosphere.<br>
        <strong>2. Condensation:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        As water vapor rises higher in the atmosphere, it cools down. The cooling causes the water vapor to change back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds and fog.<br>
        <strong>3. Precipitation:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        When water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This is called precipitation.<br>
        <strong>4. Collection/Runoff:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        The precipitated water collects in water bodies like oceans, rivers, lakes, and also soaks into the ground (infiltration) to form groundwater. Some water is absorbed by plants, and some flows over land back to water bodies (runoff). The cycle then repeats.<br>
        (Accept also: Transpiration - water released by plants; Sublimation - ice directly to vapor)</p>

        <p><strong>15.</strong> Litmus paper test (4 marks):<br>
        <strong>a) Red litmus in a base:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        Red litmus paper turns blue when dipped in a basic (alkaline) solution.<br>
        <strong>b) Blue litmus in an acid:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        Blue litmus paper turns red when dipped in an acidic solution.<br>
        <strong>c) Neutral substance:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        A neutral substance is neither acidic nor basic. It has a pH of 7.<br>
        Example: Pure water, common salt solution (NaCl solution)<br>
        <strong>d) Litmus papers in neutral solution:</strong> (1 mark)<br>
        In a neutral solution, both red and blue litmus papers will remain unchanged - red stays red, blue stays blue. There is no color change in either litmus paper.</p>
