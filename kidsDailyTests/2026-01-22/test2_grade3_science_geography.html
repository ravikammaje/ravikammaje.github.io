        The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth.<br>
        <strong>Steps:</strong><br>
        1. <strong>Evaporation:</strong> Water from oceans, rivers, and lakes turns into water vapor due to heat from the sun<br>

        <p><strong>12.</strong> Main parts of a plant (4 marks - 1 mark for each part with function):<br>
        1. <strong>Roots:</strong> Absorb water and minerals from the soil and hold the plant firmly in the ground<br>
        2. <strong>Stem:</strong> Carries water and nutrients to all parts of the plant and supports the plant<br>
        3. <strong>Leaves:</strong> Make food for the plant through photosynthesis<br>
        4. <strong>Flowers:</strong> Help in reproduction and produce seeds/fruits</p>
