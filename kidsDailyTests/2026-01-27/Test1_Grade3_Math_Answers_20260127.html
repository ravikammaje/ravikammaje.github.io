                    <strong>Answer: c) 47</strong><br>
                    An odd number is a number that is not divisible by 2 (it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). 24, 38, and 52 all end in even digits, so they are even numbers. 47 ends in 7, which is an odd digit, so 47 is an odd number.

                    Ones: 3 − 8 (cannot do, borrow from tens). But tens digit is 0, so borrow from hundreds.<br>
                    Hundreds: 5 becomes 4, tens: 0 becomes 10, then borrow 1 to ones: tens becomes 9, ones: 13 − 8 = 5.<br>

                    We know that 1 kg = 1000 g.<br>
                    So 3 kg = 3 × 1000 = 3000 g.<br>
                    3 kg 200 g = 3000 g + 200 g = 3200 g.

                <strong>Answer: 4,897 &lt; 4,978</strong><br>
                Step 1: Compare the thousands digit: both have 4 (same).<br>
                Step 2: Compare the hundreds digit: 8 vs 9. Since 8 &lt; 9, we know 4,897 is less than 4,978.<br>
                Therefore, 4,897 &lt; 4,978.

                <strong>Answer: 3 students finished between them.</strong><br>
                The positions between 3rd and 7th are: 4th, 5th, and 6th.<br>
                So 3 students finished between Reena and Meena.<br>

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: 47 ÷ 6 = 7 remainder 5</strong><br>
                Step 1: Find how many times 6 goes into 47. 6 × 7 = 42 (this is less than 47).<br>
                Step 2: 6 × 8 = 48 (this is more than 47, so 8 is too many).<br>
                Step 3: Quotient = 7.<br>
                Step 4: Remainder = 47 − 42 = 5.<br>
                So 47 ÷ 6 = 7 remainder 5.

                <strong>Answer: 2 litres = 2000 ml. Water left = 1250 ml.</strong><br>
                Step 1: Convert litres to millilitres. 1 litre = 1000 ml, so 2 litres = 2 × 1000 = 2000 ml.<br>
                Step 2: Pour out 750 ml. Water left = 2000 − 750 = 1250 ml.

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: Mango is the most liked fruit, chosen by 14 children.</strong><br>
                Step 1: Count the tally marks.<br>
                Apple: |||| |||| | = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 children.<br>
                Banana: |||| ||| = 5 + 3 = 8 children.<br>
                Mango: |||| |||| |||| = 5 + 5 + 4 = 14 children.<br>
                Step 2: Compare: 14 &gt; 11 &gt; 8.<br>
                So Mango is the most liked fruit with 14 children choosing it.

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                Step 1: Find the total number of chairs.<br>
                Total chairs = 9 rows × 12 chairs per row = 108 chairs.<br><br>
                Step 2: Remove the broken chairs.<br>
                Chairs left after removing broken ones = 108 − 15 = 93 chairs.<br><br>
                Step 3: Find how many empty chairs remain after students sit down.<br>
                Empty chairs = 93 − 85 = 8 empty chairs.<br><br>
                <strong>There are 93 chairs after removing the broken ones, and 8 empty chairs remain after 85 students sit down.</strong>

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                Step 1: Calculate the total money Arjun has.<br>
                Three ₹100 notes = 3 × 100 = ₹300<br>
                Two ₹50 notes = 2 × 50 = ₹100<br>
                Five ₹10 coins = 5 × 10 = ₹50<br>
                Total money = 300 + 100 + 50 = ₹450<br><br>
                Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent.<br>
                Cost of book = ₹175<br>
                Cost of pen = ₹45<br>
                Total spent = 175 + 45 = ₹220<br><br>
                Step 3: Calculate money left.<br>
                Money left = 450 − 220 = ₹230<br><br>

                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>a) What is the next number?</strong><br>
                The next number is 42.<br><br>
                <strong>b) Explain the rule of this pattern.</strong><br>
                Find the differences between consecutive numbers:<br>
                6 − 2 = 4<br>
                12 − 6 = 6<br>
                20 − 12 = 8<br>
                30 − 20 = 10<br>
                The differences are: 4, 6, 8, 10, ... (increasing by 2 each time).<br>
                So the next difference = 12, and the next number = 30 + 12 = 42.<br><br>
                <strong>c) What would be the 8th number in this pattern?</strong><br>

                <strong>a) Find the third angle of the triangle.</strong><br>
                The sum of all angles in a triangle = 180°.<br>
                First angle = 60°, Second angle = 70°.<br>
                Third angle = 180° − 60° − 70° = 180° − 130° = 50°.<br>
                The third angle is 50°.<br><br>
                <strong>b) What is each angle of a rectangle?</strong><br>
                A rectangle has 4 right angles.<br>
                Each right angle = 90°.<br>
                So each angle of a rectangle is 90°.<br><br>
                <strong>c) How many right angles are there in a square?</strong><br>
                A square has 4 right angles (each corner is a 90° angle).<br>
                The student should draw a square and mark a small square symbol at each of the 4 corners to indicate the right angles.<br><br>
