                    Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of the heated material itself. In liquids and gases, when a portion is heated, it becomes lighter and rises, while the cooler portion sinks, creating convection currents. Conduction mainly occurs in solids, and radiation does not require a medium.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-style: italic;">Answer the following questions in detail.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <p>1. a) What is a longitudinal wave? How does sound travel through air?<br>
            b) Why can sound not travel through a vacuum?<br>
            c) Explain the echo effect. What is the minimum distance required between the source of sound and the reflecting surface for an echo to be heard? <span class="subject-tag">Physics</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>a) Longitudinal wave and sound travel:</strong><br>
                A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the particles of the medium vibrate back and forth in the same direction as the wave travels, creating alternate compressions (regions of high pressure) and rarefactions (regions of low pressure).<br>
                Sound travels through air as a longitudinal wave. When an object vibrates, it pushes the air molecules next to it, creating compressions. These compressions then push the next set of molecules, creating a chain reaction that carries the sound forward.<br><br>
                <strong>b) Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because:</strong><br>
                Sound needs a material medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel. In a vacuum, there are no molecules to vibrate, so sound waves cannot be produced or transmitted. This was demonstrated by Robert Boyle's experiment with a bell in a vacuum jar.<br><br>
                <strong>c) Echo:</strong><br>
                An echo is the repetition of sound caused by the reflection of sound waves from a hard surface (like a wall, cliff, or building). When sound strikes a surface, it bounces back to the listener.<br>
                The minimum distance required between the source and the reflecting surface for an echo to be heard is <strong>17.2 metres</strong> (approximately). This is because the human ear can distinguish two sounds only if there is a time gap of at least 0.1 seconds between them. At the speed of sound in air (~344 m/s), the sound must travel a total distance of 34.4 m (to the surface and back), so the minimum distance = 34.4 / 2 = 17.2 m.

                <strong>b) Difference between atom and molecule:</strong><br>
                An <strong>atom</strong> is the smallest particle of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction. It may or may not exist independently.<br>
                Examples: Hydrogen atom (H), Sodium atom (Na).<br><br>
                A <strong>molecule</strong> is the smallest particle of a substance (element or compound) that can exist independently and retains all the properties of that substance. It is made up of two or more atoms bonded together.<br>
                Examples: Water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O), Oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>).<br><br>
                <strong>c) Radical:</strong><br>
                A radical is a group of atoms of different elements that behaves as a single unit in chemical reactions. It carries a charge and cannot exist independently.<br>
                Examples:<br>
                1. Sulphate radical &mdash; SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup><br>
                2. Hydroxide radical &mdash; OH<sup>&minus;</sup><br>

                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>a) Five-kingdom classification:</strong><br>
                1. <strong>Monera:</strong> Unicellular, prokaryotic organisms (no true nucleus). Example: Bacteria.<br>
                2. <strong>Protista:</strong> Unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. Example: Amoeba.<br>
                3. <strong>Fungi:</strong> Multicellular (mostly), heterotrophic organisms that feed on dead organic matter (saprophytes). Example: Mushroom.<br>
                4. <strong>Plantae:</strong> Multicellular, autotrophic organisms that make their own food by photosynthesis. Example: Rose plant.<br>
                5. <strong>Animalia:</strong> Multicellular, heterotrophic organisms that can move. Example: Dog.<br><br>
                <strong>b) Mushrooms belong to kingdom Fungi.</strong><br>
                They are not classified as plants because:<br>
                &bull; They do not have chlorophyll and cannot make their own food by photosynthesis.<br>
                &bull; They are heterotrophic &mdash; they obtain nutrition by absorbing nutrients from dead or decaying organic matter (saprophytic nutrition).<br>
                &bull; Their cell walls are made of chitin, not cellulose like plants.<br><br>
                <strong>c) Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic:</strong><br>
                <strong>Prokaryotic organisms:</strong> Have no true nucleus; genetic material is not enclosed in a nuclear membrane. They lack membrane-bound organelles. Example: Bacteria.<br>
                <strong>Eukaryotic organisms:</strong> Have a well-defined nucleus enclosed in a nuclear membrane. They have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, etc. Example: Human cells (or any plant/animal).

                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>a) Weathering:</strong><br>
                Weathering is the process of breaking down of rocks on the Earth's surface by natural agents such as wind, water, temperature changes, and living organisms.<br><br>
                <strong>Three types of weathering:</strong><br>
                1. <strong>Mechanical (Physical) weathering:</strong> Breaking of rocks by physical forces without changing their chemical composition. Example: Frost action &mdash; water enters cracks in rocks, freezes and expands, causing the rock to break.<br>
                2. <strong>Chemical weathering:</strong> Breaking of rocks by chemical reactions that change the mineral composition. Example: Acid rain dissolving limestone rocks.<br>
                3. <strong>Biological weathering:</strong> Breaking of rocks by living organisms. Example: Tree roots growing into cracks and widening them, eventually splitting the rock.<br><br>
                <strong>b) Soil Profile (layers from top to bottom):</strong><br>
                1. <strong>O-Horizon (Organic layer):</strong> Topmost layer of decomposed leaves, twigs, and organic matter (humus).<br>
                2. <strong>A-Horizon (Topsoil):</strong> Dark-coloured layer rich in humus and minerals; best for plant growth.<br>
                3. <strong>B-Horizon (Subsoil):</strong> Contains minerals washed down from the A-horizon; lighter in colour, less humus.<br>
                4. <strong>C-Horizon (Weathered rock):</strong> Partially broken-down rock fragments (parent material).<br>
                5. <strong>R-Horizon (Bedrock):</strong> Solid, unweathered rock at the bottom.<br><br>
                <strong>c) Importance and methods of soil conservation:</strong><br>
                Soil conservation is important because soil is a non-renewable resource that takes thousands of years to form. Without it, plants cannot grow, leading to food shortages, loss of habitats, and environmental damage.<br><br>
                <strong>Two methods of soil conservation:</strong><br>
                1. <strong>Terrace farming:</strong> Building step-like platforms on hillsides to slow down water flow and prevent soil erosion.<br>
                2. <strong>Afforestation:</strong> Planting trees to hold the soil together with their roots and protect it from wind and water erosion.<br>

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>a) How a thermos flask works:</strong><br>
                A thermos flask minimises heat transfer by all three methods:<br>
                &bull; <strong>Vacuum between double walls:</strong> Prevents heat transfer by conduction and convection (no medium for molecules to transfer heat).<br>
                &bull; <strong>Silvered/shiny inner walls:</strong> Prevents heat transfer by radiation (reflects heat rays back).<br>
                &bull; <strong>Cork/plastic stopper:</strong> Prevents heat loss by conduction and convection through the opening (cork and plastic are poor conductors).<br>
                &bull; <strong>Outer plastic/metal casing:</strong> Provides insulation and prevents conduction from the outside.<br><br>
                <strong>b) Temperature conversion:</strong><br>
                F = (9/5 &times; C) + 32<br>
                F = (9/5 &times; 50) + 32<br>
                F = (450/5) + 32<br>
                F = 90 + 32<br>
                <strong>F = 122&deg;F</strong><br><br>
                <strong>c) Two effects of heat on matter:</strong><br>
                1. <strong>Expansion:</strong> When matter is heated, it expands (increases in size/volume). This is true for solids, liquids, and gases. Example: Railway tracks have gaps to allow for expansion in summer.<br>
                2. <strong>Change of state:</strong> Heat can cause matter to change its state &mdash; solid to liquid (melting), liquid to gas (evaporation/boiling). Example: Ice melts to water when heated.
