        <br>
        2. <strong>Smooth/Unstriated/Involuntary Muscle:</strong> Found in walls of internal organs like stomach, intestines, blood vessels<br>
        <br>
        3. <strong>Cardiac Muscle:</strong> Found only in the heart, works continuously throughout life<br>
        <br>

    <div class="answer">
        <strong>10.</strong> A thermos flask keeps liquids hot by preventing all three methods of heat transfer:<br>
        <br>
        1. <strong>Conduction:</strong> Prevented by the vacuum (empty space) between the double walls. Since there is no medium, heat cannot transfer by conduction.<br>
        <br>
        2. <strong>Convection:</strong> Also prevented by the vacuum, as convection requires a medium (air/liquid) to transfer heat.<br>
        <br>
        3. <strong>Radiation:</strong> Prevented by the silvered/shiny inner walls which reflect heat radiation back into the liquid.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Award marks for mentioning vacuum (1 mark) and silvered walls/reflection (1 mark).</em>
    </div>

    <h2>Section C: Long Answer Questions (20 Marks)</h2>
    
    <div class="answer">
        <strong>11.</strong> Three methods of heat transfer:<br>
        <br>
        <strong>1. Conduction:</strong><br>
        - Heat transfer through direct contact between particles<br>
        - Occurs in solids (especially metals)<br>
        - Requires a medium<br>
        - Example: A metal spoon becoming hot when placed in hot tea; heat traveling through an iron rod when one end is heated<br>
        <br>
        <strong>2. Convection:</strong><br>
        - Heat transfer through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases)<br>
        - Occurs when heated particles move from hot region to cold region<br>
        - Requires a medium<br>
        - Example: Water boiling in a pot (hot water rises, cold water sinks); sea breeze and land breeze; heating a room with a heater<br>
        <br>
        <strong>3. Radiation:</strong><br>
        - Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves<br>
        - Does NOT require a medium (can travel through vacuum)<br>
        - Travels at the speed of light<br>
        - Example: Heat from the Sun reaching Earth; feeling warmth near a fire even without touching it<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Answer to question:</strong> Radiation does NOT require a medium for heat transfer.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Award marks: Each method with explanation and example (1 mark each = 3 marks), Identifying radiation as not requiring medium (1 mark)</em>

    <div class="answer">
        <strong>15.</strong> Properties of Water:<br>
        <br>
        a) <strong>Three states of water:</strong><br>
        <br>
        1. <strong>Solid (Ice):</strong> Below 0°C (freezing point)<br>
        - Water freezes at 0°C to form ice<br>
        <br>
        2. <strong>Liquid (Water):</strong> Between 0°C and 100°C<br>
        - Water exists as liquid at normal room temperature<br>
        <br>
        3. <strong>Gas (Water vapor/Steam):</strong> Above 100°C (boiling point)<br>
        - Water boils at 100°C to form steam/water vapor<br>
        <br>
        Note: These temperatures are at normal atmospheric pressure (1 atm or 760 mm Hg)<br>
        <br>
        b) <strong>Water as a universal solvent:</strong><br>
        Water is called a universal solvent because it can dissolve more substances than any other liquid. Most ionic compounds, salts, sugars, acids, bases, and many gases dissolve in water. This property makes water essential for life, as it helps transport nutrients and minerals in living organisms.<br>
        <br>
        c) <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
        - <strong>Substance that dissolves:</strong> Sugar, salt (sodium chloride), potassium permanganate, copper sulfate<br>
        - <strong>Substance that does NOT dissolve:</strong> Sand, oil, chalk powder, wood<br>
        <br>
        <em>Award marks: States with temperatures (1.5 marks), Universal solvent explanation (1.5 marks), Examples (1 mark)</em>
