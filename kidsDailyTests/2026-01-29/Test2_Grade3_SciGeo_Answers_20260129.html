        <div class="question">
            <p>3. The Sun is called the natural source of light and energy. <span class="subject-tag">Science</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>a) Solar energy and its uses:</strong></p>
                <p>- Solar energy is the energy we get from the Sun in the form of light and heat</p>
                <p>Uses:</p>
                <p>1. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity</p>
                <p>2. Solar water heaters warm water using sunlight</p>
                <p>(Also: drying clothes, cooking with solar cookers)</p>
                <p><strong>b) Why we have day and night:</strong></p>
                <p>- Earth rotates (spins) on its axis</p>
                <p>- One complete rotation takes 24 hours</p>
                <p>- The side facing the Sun has day (receives sunlight)</p>
                <p>- The side away from the Sun has night (no sunlight)</p>
                <p><strong>c) What would happen without the Sun:</strong></p>
                <p>- Earth would become very cold and dark</p>
                <p>- Plants could not make food (no photosynthesis)</p>
                <p>- All living things would eventually die</p>
                <p>- Water would freeze</p>
                <p><strong>d) Things that need sunlight to survive:</strong></p>
                <p>1. Plants (for photosynthesis and growth)</p>
                <p>2. Animals (for warmth and to find food)</p>
                <p>(Also: Humans need sunlight for Vitamin D)</p>

        <div class="question">
            <p>4. Earth experiences different seasons during the year. <span class="subject-tag">Geography</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>a) Why we have different seasons:</strong></p>
                <p>- Earth revolves (moves in an orbit) around the Sun</p>
                <p>- Earth's axis is tilted at an angle</p>
                <p>- As Earth moves, different parts receive more or less direct sunlight</p>
                <p>- This causes seasons to change throughout the year</p>
                <p><strong>b) Weather during summer season in India:</strong></p>
                <p>- Very hot temperatures (can reach 40-45°C in many places)</p>
                <p>- Days are longer, nights are shorter</p>
                <p>- Dry and sunny weather</p>
                <p>- People wear light cotton clothes</p>
                <p><strong>c) Monsoon season:</strong></p>
                <p>- Heavy rainfall occurs during monsoon (June to September)</p>
                <p>- Winds bring rain from the Indian Ocean</p>
                <p>- Important for farmers because:</p>
                <p>  - Rain fills rivers and provides water for crops</p>
                <p>  - Rice, sugarcane, and many crops depend on monsoon rain</p>
                <p>  - Groundwater gets recharged</p>
                <p><strong>d) Season for woolen clothes:</strong></p>
                <p>- Winter season (December to February)</p>
                <p>- We wear woolen clothes because the weather is cold</p>
                <p>- Wool keeps our body warm by trapping heat</p>

                <p><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Potato, Tomato, Spinach (also: Carrot, Cauliflower, Beans)</p>
                <p><strong>b) What we get from sugarcane stem:</strong></p>
                <p>- Sugar (gur/jaggery)</p>
                <p>- Sugarcane juice</p>
                <p><strong>c) Two spices and the plant parts they come from:</strong></p>
                <p>1. <strong>Clove</strong> - comes from flower buds</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Ginger</strong> - comes from underground stem (rhizome)</p>
                <p>(Also: Cinnamon - bark, Pepper - fruit, Turmeric - rhizome, Cumin - seeds)</p>
                <p><strong>d) How plants help the environment:</strong></p>
                <p>1. Plants release oxygen which we breathe</p>
                <p>2. Plants absorb carbon dioxide and help clean the air</p>
                <p>(Also: Plants provide shade, prevent soil erosion, give shelter to animals, maintain water cycle)</p>
