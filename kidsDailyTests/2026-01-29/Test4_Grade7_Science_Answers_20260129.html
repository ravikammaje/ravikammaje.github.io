            <p>4. Why does a thermos flask keep liquids hot or cold? <span class="subject-tag">Physics</span> <span class="marks">[2]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>A thermos flask has a double-walled glass container with a vacuum between the walls.</p>
                <p>1. <strong>Vacuum prevents conduction and convection</strong> - heat cannot transfer through empty space by these methods.</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Silvered walls prevent radiation</strong> - the shiny surface reflects heat radiation back inside (or outside for cold liquids).</p>
                <p>3. Cork/plastic stopper prevents heat loss from the top.</p>
                <p>This minimizes all three modes of heat transfer, keeping liquids at their original temperature.</p>

        <div class="section-header">Section C: Long Answer Questions (5 x 4 = 20 Marks)</div>

        <div class="question">
            <p>1. Sound and its properties <span class="subject-tag">Physics</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>a) What is sound? How is it produced?</strong></p>
                <p>Sound is a form of energy that produces the sensation of hearing. It is produced by vibrations of objects. When an object vibrates, it creates disturbances in the surrounding medium (air, water, or solid), causing compressions and rarefactions that travel as longitudinal waves.</p>

                <p><strong>b) Why sound cannot travel through vacuum:</strong></p>
                <p>Sound requires a material medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel. It propagates through the vibration of particles in the medium. In a vacuum, there are no particles to vibrate, so sound cannot travel. This is why astronauts cannot hear each other directly in space.</p>

                <p><strong>c) What is an echo? Conditions for hearing echo:</strong></p>
                <p>An echo is the repetition of sound caused by reflection of sound waves from a hard surface.</p>
                <p>Conditions for hearing an echo:</p>
                <p>- The minimum distance between the source and reflecting surface should be at least 17.2 meters (at 20°C)</p>
                <p>- The reflecting surface should be large and hard</p>
                <p>- The time gap between original sound and echo should be at least 0.1 seconds</p>

                <p><strong>d) Distance calculation:</strong></p>
                <p>Time = 5 seconds</p>
                <p>Speed of sound = 340 m/s</p>
                <p>Distance = Speed x Time</p>
                <p>Distance = 340 x 5 = 1700 meters</p>
                <p><strong>The thunderstorm is 1700 m (or 1.7 km) away.</strong></p>

        <div class="question">
            <p>2. Atomic Structure and Valency <span class="subject-tag">Chemistry</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>a) What is an atom? Subatomic particles:</strong></p>
                <p>An atom is the smallest particle of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction while retaining the chemical properties of that element.</p>
                <p><strong>Three subatomic particles:</strong></p>
                <p>1. Proton - positive charge (+1), found in nucleus</p>
                <p>2. Neutron - no charge (neutral), found in nucleus</p>
                <p>3. Electron - negative charge (-1), orbits around nucleus</p>

                <p><strong>b) Valency definition:</strong></p>
                <p>Valency is the combining capacity of an atom. It is the number of electrons an atom can lose, gain, or share to complete its outermost shell (achieve a stable configuration of 8 electrons, or 2 for the first shell).</p>
                <p>Valency is determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom.</p>

                <p><strong>c) Symbols and valencies:</strong></p>
                <p>- Calcium (Ca) - Valency 2</p>
                <p>- Chlorine (Cl) - Valency 1</p>
                <p>- Nitrogen (N) - Valency 3</p>
                <p>- Sulphur (S) - Valency 2</p>

                <p><strong>d) Chemical formulae:</strong></p>

                <p>Formula: Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p>3. Plant and Animal Tissues <span class="subject-tag">Biology</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>a) What is a tissue?</strong></p>
                <p>A tissue is a group of cells that are similar in structure and work together to perform a specific function.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
                <p>- Division of labor in the body</p>
                <p>- Efficient functioning of organs</p>
                <p>- Specialized cells for specialized functions</p>

                <p><strong>b) Four types of animal tissues and their functions:</strong></p>
                <p>1. <strong>Epithelial tissue</strong> - Covers body surfaces and lines internal organs; provides protection</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Connective tissue</strong> - Connects and supports different parts of the body; examples: blood, bone, cartilage</p>
                <p>3. <strong>Muscular tissue</strong> - Enables movement through contraction and relaxation</p>
                <p>4. <strong>Nervous tissue</strong> - Transmits nerve impulses; controls and coordinates body activities</p>

                <p><strong>c) Xylem tissue:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Xylem consists of dead cells with thick, lignified walls. It includes vessels, tracheids, xylem fibers, and xylem parenchyma.</p>
                <p><strong>Function:</strong></p>
                <p>- Transports water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves (upward)</p>
                <p>- Provides mechanical support to the plant</p>

                <p><strong>d) Voluntary vs Involuntary muscles:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Voluntary muscles:</strong></p>
                <p>- Under conscious control</p>
                <p>- Also called skeletal/striated muscles</p>
                <p>- Example: Muscles of arms, legs</p>
                <p><strong>Involuntary muscles:</strong></p>
                <p>- Not under conscious control</p>
                <p>- Also called smooth muscles</p>
                <p>- Example: Muscles of stomach, intestines</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <p>4. Heat Transfer <span class="subject-tag">Physics</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>a) Three modes of heat transfer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Conduction:</strong> Transfer of heat through a material without the actual movement of particles. Heat passes from particle to particle. Occurs mainly in solids.</p>
                <p><strong>Convection:</strong> Transfer of heat through the actual movement of heated particles (fluid flow). Occurs in liquids and gases.</p>
                <p><strong>Radiation:</strong> Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves without requiring any medium. Can occur through vacuum.</p>

                <p><strong>b) Metal utensils with wooden/plastic handles:</strong></p>
                <p>- <strong>Metal (body):</strong> Good conductor of heat - allows quick and uniform heating of food</p>
                <p>- <strong>Wood/Plastic (handle):</strong> Poor conductors (insulators) - prevents heat from reaching our hands, avoiding burns</p>
                <p>This combination allows efficient cooking while maintaining safety.</p>

                <p><strong>c) Sea breeze and land breeze:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Sea Breeze (Day):</strong></p>
                <p>- During day, land heats up faster than sea</p>
                <p>- Hot air over land rises (convection)</p>
                <p>- Cooler air from sea moves toward land to replace it</p>
                <p>- This creates a breeze from sea to land</p>
                <p><strong>Land Breeze (Night):</strong></p>
                <p>- At night, land cools faster than sea</p>
                <p>- Warm air over sea rises</p>
                <p>- Cooler air from land moves toward sea</p>
                <p>- This creates a breeze from land to sea</p>

                <p><strong>d) Examples of heat transfer by radiation:</strong></p>
                <p>1. Heat from the Sun reaching Earth through space</p>
                <p>2. Heat from a fire reaching us without touching it</p>
                <p>(Also: Heat from a room heater, Heat felt near a hot bulb)</p>

        <div class="question">
            <p>5. Weathering and Rock Formation <span class="subject-tag">Geography</span> <span class="marks">[4]</span></p>
            <div class="solution">
                <p><strong>a) Weathering and its types:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Weathering</strong> is the breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by natural agents like water, wind, temperature changes, and living organisms.</p>
                <p><strong>Three types:</strong></p>
                <p>1. <strong>Physical/Mechanical weathering</strong> - Breaking of rocks by physical forces (temperature changes, frost action, wind)</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Chemical weathering</strong> - Decomposition of rocks by chemical reactions (oxidation, carbonation, hydration)</p>
                <p>3. <strong>Biological weathering</strong> - Breaking of rocks by living organisms (plant roots, burrowing animals)</p>

                <p><strong>b) Formation of igneous rocks:</strong></p>
                <p>Igneous rocks are formed when hot molten magma from inside the Earth cools and solidifies.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Intrusive igneous rocks:</strong> Form when magma cools slowly inside Earth (large crystals). Example: Granite</p>
                <p>- <strong>Extrusive igneous rocks:</strong> Form when lava cools quickly on Earth's surface (small or no crystals). Example: Basalt</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Granite, Basalt, Pumice, Obsidian</p>

                <p><strong>c) Sedimentary vs Metamorphic rocks:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Sedimentary rocks:</strong></p>
                <p>- Formed from layers of sediments deposited over millions of years</p>
                <p>- Often contain fossils</p>
                <p>- Layered structure</p>
                <p>- Example: Sandstone, Limestone</p>
                <p><strong>Metamorphic rocks:</strong></p>
                <p>- Formed when existing rocks change due to intense heat and pressure</p>
                <p>- Usually harder than original rock</p>
                <p>- May have wavy bands or layers</p>
                <p>- Example: Marble (from limestone), Slate (from shale)</p>

                <p><strong>d) Importance and methods of soil conservation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
                <p>- Soil is essential for growing crops and food production</p>
                <p>- Takes thousands of years to form; once lost, difficult to replace</p>
                <p>- Supports plant life and ecosystems</p>
                <p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
